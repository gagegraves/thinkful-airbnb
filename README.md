# Thinkfulbnb

This is a project for my thinkful course where the HTML was handed to me, and I had to style it using CSS/Bootstrap.
The project was made using HTML/CSS/
It was a rigorous project that really strengthened my CSS and design skills. 
It is mobile-responsive and was created with the mobile-first development method in mind.
